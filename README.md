How to get a virtual environment with Coldtype installed: https://coldtype.goodhertz.com/install.html

With a virtualenv installed and activated, you can:

- `pip install coldtype[viewer]`
- `coldtype demo` (to verify itâ€™s working), then:
- `coldtype part_1/00_vf.py`
- `coldtype part_1/01_animation.py`
- etc.


Nice VS Code extensions:

- "Rainbow Brackets" (or the new built-in option https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/09/29/bracket-pair-colorization)
- "indent-rainbow"
- "Nudge"
